# Kelmarsh-Wind-Power-Model
This project puts forward a hybrid modeling approach for forecasting wind farm power output at a wind farm. It couples physics-based modeling—employing blade element momentum (BEM) theory with and without yaw misalignment corrections and wake effects—with data-driven machine learning algorithms. The workflow entails forecasting future wind speeds from next month by time series forecasting, heavy feature engineering, and model blending which adaptively weight physics and ML predictions based on wind condition and turbulence level. Comprehensive validation using conventional measures of standard error, Monte Carlo experiments, and sensitivity analysis is applied to assess uncertainty and determine the performance of models. The objective of this method is to improve the accuracy and reliability of wind power predictions, which are beneficial for renewable energy management.
